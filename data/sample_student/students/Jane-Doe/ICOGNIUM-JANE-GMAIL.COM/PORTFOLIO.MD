<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>



# Jane's Code For INCOGNIUM Week 4

This is my code for the **"simple image classifier in tensorflow"** via [INCOGNIUM curriculum](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium/blob/master/README.md).

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>




# Jane's Code For INCOGNIUM Week 5

This is my code for the **"generative adversarial artificial neural network"** via [INCOGNIUM curriculum](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium/blob/master/README.md).

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>



# Jane's Code For INCOGNIUM Week 6

This is my code for the **"deep q network"** via [INCOGNIUM curriculum](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium/blob/master/README.md).

<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


# Jane's Code For INCOGNIUM Final Semester

This is my custom code that utilizes the **"convolutional artificial neural network"** and the **"deep q network"**. This code learns how to save energy for an electric grid for [JPS](https://www.jpsco.com), by optimizing when components turn off/on. The deep q network uses a convolutional artificial neural network as its storage structure, on the input space of a 3d game like setup based on JPS' energy grid.
