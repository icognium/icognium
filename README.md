# Why learn Ai development and application?
1. [The world's smartest people are switching careers into Ai research and application/productization!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/god-bennett_httpslnkdinebrmfzu-activity-6761811288260694016-70Ys).
2. According to [PwC Global](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html), Ai will yield a [15 trillion dollar market cap by the year 2030](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/02/25/ai-will-add-15-trillion-to-the-world-economy-by-2030/?sh=76b9bd4e1852). This is around the same time [800 million jobs shall be automated away, according to Bank of America](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42170100).
 * It is thus key to intimately benefit in this automation effort, rather than fail to do so.

# Introduction
1. Brain inspired computer code or smart apps, called **AGI or artificial _general_ intelligence** (predicted to happen by [as soon as 2029 or sooner](http://www.businessinsider.com/ray-kurzweil-thinks-well-have-human-level-ai-by-2029-2014-12)), will perhaps one day be [mankind's last invention!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9snY7lhJA4c) For now though, AGI's predecessor, called **artificial _narrow_ intelligence**, also called **artificial intelligence**, can do amazing stuff like [diagnose diseases better than human doctors](https://futurism.com/ai-diagnose-heart-disease-lung-cancer-more-accurately-doctors/), or [give game characters the ability to learn to navigate game environments without human aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44)! 

* [Google, Microsoft etc, are working towards AGI today](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00887-x).

2. Crucially, the **Jamaican government** [has recognized that artificial narrow intelligence, a part of machine learning, is a threat to jobs](http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/news/20180418/beware-artificial-intelligence-wheatley-warns-bpo-sector). Notably, [here's a list of jobs where robots or smart software are already replacing humans](https://blog.cheapism.com/robots-taking-jobs/). 

3. As the **1st known machine learning school established in Jamaica/Carribean** in 2016/2020, [Machine Learning Jamaica Institute](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium) which was later adapted into an accredited course called [ASTIS](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/ASTIS/tree/main), and thereafter, adapted into the latest form, namely a new tangible self driving, and practical paths known as [iCognium](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium) seeks to help more and more Jamaicans to find out what steps they can take to acquire skills needed to **stay relevant** in a world that's more and more driven by artificial intelligence, that shall replace more and more jobs with physical robots and or smart software. 

4. As such, [iCognium](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/icognium) is an institute that aims to bring more Jamaicans into the modern world of artificial intelligence and programming through fun, tailored lectures. Pertinently, see the "why" tab on the [iCognium website](hmlj-institute.appspot.com), to find out why **high-schoolers, or even busy Masters/PhD/Professor people who are not trained in the machine learning field can participate in modern machine learning**!



# Rapid/Optimal ~6+ Week Curriculum
This curriculum is designed to cater to two main categories of users, including **non-programmers** and **programmers**. Those two categories naturally cover persons including those with **High school courses, Bachelors degrees, Masters degrees, PhDs, and Professorships**.

The two main categories above are expressible as 2 types, based on the goals that [iCognium](https://icognium.github.io) desginates its students to perform.

As such, from here on out, you select one of the types below, and begin your learning process:

1. [iCognium For Non programmers (Type A)](https://github.com/icognium/icognium/tree/main/data/type_a/README.md)
2. [iCognium For Programmers (Type B)](https://github.com/icognium/icognium/tree/main/data/type_b/README.md)

![Alt Text](https://github.com/icognium/icognium/blob/main/data/tick.png)

By the time you complete either one of [iCognium](https://icognium.github.io)'s curriculum types above, you would be a marketable candidate, qualified to attain remote work with the capability to earn [beyond 80,000 USD per year](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/s/Remote-Data-Scientist-Salary), whether you're a high schooler or professor who was not priorly trained in [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning). Also, you would be in far better position for local work, and better able to prepare for automation of more and more jobs in the globe, and in the country.


# Curriculum Requirements
1. Candidates must have at least passed the [GSAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Six_Achievement_Test) or completed the [PEP](http://www.moe.gov.jm/primary-exit-profile-pep) or something similar. (From Primary to Tertiary Education and beyond, i.e. Additionally, up to PhD/Professor level candidates are welcome too!) 
* The requirement above essentially concerns just before high school level all the way up to PhD/Professor people who want to profit from Ai development!
2. Candidates must be willing to devote at most 6 to 8+ weeks to iCognium's curriculum. In other words, candidates must be willing to build himself/herself, by acquiring machine learning skills through iCognium's 6-8+ week curriculum.
3. Candidates need to have access to [machine learning computers](https://pub.towardsai.net/best-laptops-for-machine-learning-deep-learning-data-science-ml-f55602197593), or online machine learning compute like [free colab instances](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).
4. This course also advises for the use of datasets such as those [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Ai/Machine learning is normally complete with ingredients:
* Ai Knowledge/Skills (which this course builds in each candidate)
* Ai Compute
* Ai Compatible/Consumable Datasets

# Why Artificial Neural Network focussed?
![Alt Text](https://github.com/icognium/icognium/blob/main/data/logo.png)

As underlined in [prior Live Neural network sessions by organizer Bennett](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions), artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in [Universal Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem), and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, ranging from Tesla's self driving cars, to Facebook's auto face tagging Ai, iCognium targets this core field. Learning neural networks which are general models, gives rise to intuition needed to venture elsewhere if neccessary.

# Why combine artificial neural networks from scratch in with focus in practical machine learning library stack such as tensorflow/pytorch...?

⚫Pertaining to artificial neural networks from scratch in particular, as [Microsoft's Joseph Albahari says](https://youtu.be/z8DY5DndmxI?t=192) (in his csharp based neural networks from scratch lecture),  machine learning libraries are reasonably a great place to end up, but not necessarily a great place to start! 

As noted by Bennett, [understanding these broad/fundamental neural network models from scratch without machine learning libraries, builds intuition in applying and debugging machine learning libraries](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Live-Agile-Artificial-Neural-Network-Programming-Sessions).

* In addition to the above, this reasonably smart curriculum includes "dynamic pathways" assuming some or no programming knowledge in addition to artificial neural networks from scratch. (The insight (that application of neural networks from scratch is a fundamental tool), of others like Sentdex and Joseph's, requires prior programming knowledge, and pertains to learning Neural Networks' internal structure, while this curriculum accommodates candidates with no programming knowledge etc)

* This Course combines artificial neural networks from scratch, in a [beyond Joseph's code based csharp lecture, in an illustrative class diagram based Java paradigm designed for new candidates](https://github.com/g0dEngineer/JAVA_WORMHOLE/), (around 1000 lines of code without machine learning libraries), with primarily practical detailed use of python aligned machine learning library enabled projects/via tensorflow for eg, therein helping candidates to gain intuition in the usage of machine learning libraries like tensorflow. University programs tend to confluence both Java and Python, where this **Course focusses primarily on python**.

* As usual, as underlined in prior Live Neural network sessions by organizer Bennett, artificial neural networks can represent a wide variety of utilities/functions as seen in Universal Approximation Theorem, and since neural networks power most cognitive/smart apps today, ranging from Tesla's self driving cars, to Facebook's auto face tagging Ai, iCognium targets this core field. Learning neural networks which are general models, gives rise to intuition needed to venture elsewhere if necessary.
